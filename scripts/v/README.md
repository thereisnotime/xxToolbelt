# V Scripts

## Requirements

Pre-requisites:

- V

I recommend using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to manage your V versions. You can install V with asdf via:

```bash
# Add V plugin and install V
asdf plugin add v https://github.com/jthegedus/asdf-v
asdf install v latest
asdf global v latest
```
